# Pagination in React + Vite

Pagination divides content into multiple pages (like lists, tables, or search results). It helps manage large datasets by displaying only a subset of data per page, improving UI and performance.

In React, pagination is often paired with:

State hooks (useState) to manage the current page.
Effect hooks (useEffect) are used to fetch paginated data from APIs.
Global state (if pagination state needs to be accessed across components).
